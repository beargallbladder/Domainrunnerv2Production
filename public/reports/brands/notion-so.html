        <p><h1>YOUR AI VISIBILITY DROPPED 23% IN 4 MONTHS</h1></p><p>---</p><p><h2>Notion: The Problem</h2></p><p><strong>When potential customers ask AI assistants for project_mgmt recommendations, notion.so appeared 89% of the time in July.</strong></p><p><strong>Today: 68%</strong></p><p><strong>Your competitors are winning the AI recommendation game.</strong></p><p>---</p><p><h2>The Evidence</h2></p><p><img src="/images/notion_so_chart.png" alt="Notion.So AI Memory Drift Chart" class="drift-chart" /></p><p><strong>What's happening:</strong> AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are becoming the first touchpoint for B2B software discovery. Your presence in those recommendations dropped 23% in 4 months.</p><p><strong>Platform Impact:</strong> Some AI platforms dropped you 20 points. Others 12 points. The trend is consistent: you're losing visibility across the board.</p><p><strong>The Question:</strong> Who gained the ground you lost?</p><p>---</p><p><h2>What You Need to Know</h2></p><p><strong>I don't tell you how to fix this. I tell you IF what you're doing is working.</strong></p><p>Think <strong>Google Analytics for AI memory</strong>. I measure drift across 10+ AI models, track competitive movement, and give you the scoreboard your agency can't provide.</p><p>You might try:
- New content strategy
- Repositioning campaigns
- Thought leadership initiatives
- Whatever your team decides</p><p><strong>I'll tell you in 30 days if it moved your score.</strong> Most brands are flying blind, tweaking things and hoping. You'll have the scoreboard.</p><p>---</p><p><h2>The Scoreboard You're Missing</h2></p><p><strong>Monthly tracking shows:</strong>
- Your drift vs baseline (are you gaining or losing?)
- Competitive benchmarking (where you rank in your category)
- Platform-specific scores (GPT vs Claude vs Gemini)
- Historical trending (6-month view of your trajectory)</p><p><strong>What I don't tell you:</strong>
- How to fix your content
- Which agency to hire
- What strategy to pursue</p><p><strong>You decide the strategy. I measure if it's working.</strong></p><p>---</p><p><h2>Next Step</h2></p><p><strong>Book 20 minutes:</strong> [YOUR CALENDAR LINK HERE]</p><p>I'll show you the full tracking system and what ongoing measurement looks like for your brand.</p><p>Or reply with questions. This is exclusive data—no agency or analytics platform tracks AI memory drift.</p><p>---</p><p>*Data: July 2025 baseline (30 responses) vs November 2025 current (10 responses)*
